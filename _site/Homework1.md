# Homework 1

The renderer I'm making for this quarter is called Blurser. It uses OptiX. After homework1, it can do the recursive blinn-phong shading stuff. I added functionality to move the camera around the world by generating a bunch of frames(didn't bother figuring out how to limit the frame rate). And I also added some functionality for loading in .obj files that have no textures. The hardest parts of this homework were always very small annoying things, like not offseting shadows correctly, or not defining the bounding box correctly, or not passing attributes correctly. These little issues took more time than I would like for me to work out. And in the end, the tests pass on the site, but they are not 1 to 1 images.

Here are some pictures showing off some complex models I loaded in. One is buggy, but buggy can be beautiful.
